# SAFE - anonymous feedback app.
Anonymous feedback can enable senders to give honest feedback without fear of judgement.

Our project priority is to create an anonmymous feedback form that is has minimal point of entry and is sent to a chosen entity of the deparment (ie the deparment chair, our sponsor). This can be extended to multiple channels if we have the functionality of a single channel down. 

**guide for future programmers**
This is a brief how-to for compiling, running, and pushing code to heroku servers. This guide assumes you're working with the current code base. 

To run the project 
On the command line:
 npm install 
 npm start 
Connect to your local host:  http://localhost:3000
You should see the current website running. Note this is a local port, and so there is no internet connection yet. This is purely for development purposes.If you wish to change the command to start the project, please refer to the package.json.


SAFE is hosted on Herokuâ€™s web host services. This means someone can access the app through the internet via herokus servers. Mark is now the owner of this application on Heroku. 

run/push the project on heroku
On command line: 
Git push heroku main
Heroku open

**please refer to project document for details!** It is important to know the current weaknesses of the project as well as the recommended next steps. We highly reccommend this project to be a point of reference, not something to directly build on top of. This is mainly due to architecture limitations.
